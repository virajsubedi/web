    <h1> Thomas j.Watson Sr.. </h1>
    <P>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman
        and CEO of IBM.[1][2] He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson
        developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR.[3] He turned
        the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A
        leading self-made industrialist,[4] he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's
        greatest salesman when he died in 1956.</P>
